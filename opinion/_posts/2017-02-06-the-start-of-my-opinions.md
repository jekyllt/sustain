title: The Start Of My Opinions 
category: opinion
---
A couple of years back, I deleted my Facebook account. I first got it in 2006 before many of my friends and family ever did. I loved Facebook. But as time went on it slowly became more and more of a waste of time. If my feed did not show what someone was eating or a click bait title, it was an opinionated and scathing flame war of comments. As Facebook culture started to grow into what it is now, I would participate in all these activities and many times I was the immature, generalizing, and heated friend stuck in his preconceived notions that you always rolled your eyes at. It became obvious to me that these were not constructive conversations, neither for me or with whom I was engaging. I decided to withdraw myself from all political discussion on Facebook, despite my strong opinions. It was shortly after that I decided to delete my account, mainly out of concerns for my privacy and that of my family.

After recent events, I decided to recreate my Facebook identity soley based on the idea that it is the best way I can affect those in my immediate circles of influence and challenge opinions of others, and likewise have mine challenged. Much has happened between then and now: I moved to a different region of the US, I left the religion I believed in my whole life, and much more. These events, particularly the latter, have demonstrated to me the benefits of embracing vulnerability and challenging my own presumptions. It has also helped me to learn how to understand and approach those with opposing viewpoints. While I may not be the best at it, I try really hard to not be that immature, generalizing, and heated friend stuck in his preconceived notions and instead approach the conversation in a civil manner in which both parties can benefit from. So far, it's been a great experience and I've already had some of my views challenged.

However, even with Facebook, I feel the need for a more formal medium to express my thoughts. That is what this blog is for. With the results of the 2016 election, I, like many others, have felt the need to become more vocal and more active and stand up for what I believe is right. I am concerned about many things such as [trade](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/upshot/what-can-trump-do-to-overhaul-nafta-quite-a-lot.html), [foreign affairs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements), [immigration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states), and of course [racial, religious, and sexual intolerance](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration). My fear and dislike of the [surveillance state](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/just-time-trump-nsa-loosens-privacy-rules/) in the world continues. The [response](https://twitter.com/SportsPlusShow/status/769683733855088640/video/1) to peaceful protests and manifestations of free speech appalls me. I cannot silence myself any longer. 

I don't know if this blog will get much readership, I'd be thrilled if it did. But I have a lot of ideas for it's future. I am even considering starting a podcast. Either way, I hope to assume a much more activist role through the coming years.
